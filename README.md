Cosmatic Drift is a HRP fork of Station 14 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), their homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Cosmatic Drift. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
