# Reporting a security vulnerability
The vast majority of code in this repository is also present in our upstream.
You should verify if the issue is also present in [space-wizards/space-station-14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/)
and if so report the issue according to their policy below. Otherwise, please contact somebody with the `@Project Lead`
or `@Maintainer` role in our discord server (linked in the README);

## Space Wizards Security Policy
```
You can report a security vulnerability through Discord or through email.

If you want to send an email, you can contact us at <support@spacestation14.com>.
If you want to contact us through Discord, you can join [our server](https://discord.gg/MwDDf6t)
and then **privately** message anyone with the `@Wizard` or `@SS14 Maintainer` role.

In either case, **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give
you permission to do so**.
