# SPP armors
- type: entity
  parent: RMCBaseMarineArmorLight
  id: RMCArmorSPP
  name: UM5 personal armor
  description: Standard body armor of the SPP military, the UM5 (Union Medium MK5) is a medium body armor, roughly on par with the M3 pattern body armor in service with the UNMC, specialized towards ballistics protection. Unlike the M3, however, the plate has a heavier neckplate. This has earned many UN members to refer to SPP soldiers as 'tin men'.
