# CLF Armors
- type: entity
  parent: ClothingOuterStorageBase
  id: RMCCoatMilitia
  name: colonial militia hauberk
  description: The hauberk of a colonist militia member, created from boiled leather and some modern armored plates. While not the most powerful form of armor, and primitive compared to most modern suits of armor, it gives the wearer almost perfect mobility, which suits the needs of the local colonists. It is also quick to don, easy to hide, and cheap to produce in large workshops.

  description: The hauberk of a colonist militia member, created from boiled leather and some modern armored plates. While not the most powerful form of armor, and primitive compared to most modern suits of armor, it gives the wearer almost perfect mobility, which suits the needs of the local colonists. It is also quick to don, easy to hide, and cheap to produce in large workshops. This even lighter variant has some of the arm pieces removed.
