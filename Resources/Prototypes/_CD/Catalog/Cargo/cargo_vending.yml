# If you've arrived here after a failed NoCargoOrderArbitrage test, it's likely
# because the product in question contains a restock box which links to a
# vending machine inventory that has had items added to it recently and caused
# its calculated price to exceed the cost below.
#
# The costs will need to be kept in line with the inventory of the respective
# vending machines. An extra hundred or two profit margin should be fine.
