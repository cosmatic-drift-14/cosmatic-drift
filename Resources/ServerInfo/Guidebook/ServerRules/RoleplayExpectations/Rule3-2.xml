  # Rule 3.2
  Do not overly crowd an RP situation. This is mostly designed around security and people following others into departments. We do not expect you to be absolutely always cautious about this rule, nor do we intend to enforce it with a heavy hand, but please just be mindful of it, as it can seriously detract from others' RP.
  - If security is dealing with a situation, be respectful of their operation, do not needlessly intervene or chime in verbally as a third party, basically you should only be stepping in if you're taking the full side of the suspect and intend to act as an accomplice.
  - Medical and similar departments get roughly the same protections, do not follow a patient/involved person into a location such as the medical bay unless you have good reason to, for example you having information on their condition that you are going to give or an officer making an arrest.
  - In short do not barge into situations you do not belong in and force yourself into it. Treat it like a real security or medical emergency; discuss things on the sides quietly, but do not intervene.
