  # Rule 3.7
  Command and Security are expected to be competent, to be lawful, and to follow procedure.
  - Neither roles should be grossly incompetent at their job or in their judgment. You are held to higher standards and should be able to be depended upon. Be a role-model for your department.
  - You cannot take direct, unchallengeable orders from people other than your job superiors.
  - You should not knowingly break the law as either Command or Security roles.
  - Command staff should know Standard Operating Procedure and follow it to the best of their abilities. Security should know both Standard Operating Procedure and Space-Law; they should follow them and enforce them to the best of their abilities. Failure to do so will likely result in a role-ban.
  - Currently, we use the old version of Wizard's Den Space-Law; you can find this pinned in #questions on our discord or at https://wiki.spacestation14.io/w/index.php?title=Space_Law&oldid=5547
  - SOP can be found in the guidebook and on our discord
