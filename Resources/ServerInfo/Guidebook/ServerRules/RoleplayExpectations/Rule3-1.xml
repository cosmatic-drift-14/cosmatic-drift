  # Rule 3.1
  Do not intentionally prepare items or locations "just in case" a certain scenario happens unless you have proper in-character reasoning, especially if it is intended to gain an upper-hand or advantage over another player. Cosmatic Drift is heavily based around roleplay; you should generally be focused on this rather than playing to win.
  - The concept of "playing to win" is commonly referred to as "powergaming."
  - Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) dictates how areas should be locked down and what gear should be held and/or equipped during any given circumstance. Minor things such as getting a crowbar on round-start is fine, however, seeking out weapons is not.
