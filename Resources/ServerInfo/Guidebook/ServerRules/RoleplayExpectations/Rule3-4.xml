  # Rule 3.4
  This server uses a New Life rule. You may not remember any events that may have happened while you were in an unconscious or dead state. You may not retain any knowledge that you have learned whilst you were a ghost.
  - If you enter a dead state and get defibbed back to life you forget all the events that led up to your death. (This is the basic type of memory loss for anything else that is not specified)
  - If you enter a dead state and get cloned back to life you forget all the events since the beginning of the shift.
  - Respawning as a new character or taking a ghost role eliminates all memory of everything that may have happened previously in that shift.
