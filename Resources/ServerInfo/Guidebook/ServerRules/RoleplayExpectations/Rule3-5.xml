  # Rule 3.5
  Full continuity of your character and events that happen to them is to be expected. All rounds are canonical unless stated otherwise by an admin.
  - You are allowed to recall past shifts in any manner unless it violates the New Life rule.
  - Punishments you receive will be enforced and carried out in-character throughout rounds. If your character gets demoted, you are expected to stay out of that job until a reasonable amount of time has passed or you are rehired again in-game.
  - Your characters should generally hold no more than two departmental jobs and a service side job in-character. You may swap departments from time to time so long as it doesn't happen constantly or consistently.
  - Permanent death is not required, as there is an off-site DNA storages available for all crewmembers.
