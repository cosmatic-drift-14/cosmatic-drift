  # Rule 3.6
  Stay within your job, reasonable knowledge, and abilities.
  - Do not use knowledge that you have learned out-of-character while you are in-character. This is referred to as "metagaming."
  - Unless your character has a past in a particular line of work, they should not know how to do jobs outside of their own.
  - Do not do the jobs of other people for them, only play the role you signed up for. If you want to work a different job, ask the Head of Personnel for a job change. Exceptions can be made for if no active staff exist for a department.
  - Basic crew should not be knowledgeable on most non-NT technology and items unless they've experienced it in-character. Security and command may have some leeway within reason.
