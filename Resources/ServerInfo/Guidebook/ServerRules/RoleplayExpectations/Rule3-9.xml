  # Rule 3.9
  Your character and lore should be believable and fit within the universe. Don't be a Mary Sue.
  - Under normal circumstances you are not allowed to play characters that are or were extremely important members of non-player made organizations like, Central Commanders, the CEO of NT, Syndicate high commanders, Death Squad members, and so on.
  - If you're using a player-made organization, it can not be extremely important in the universe. A basic rule of thumb is that it shouldn't be powerful enough to be known by the common spacer and that it's absolutely nowhere close to the level of power that NT has.
  - Your character can not possess godlike abilities, nor can they be a god or partly a god.
  - Your character should not be in active work service to NT if they are known to be an active syndicate member. NT wouldn't hire someone who is known to be working for a hostile organization.
  - Your character can not have immunities to in-character punishments.
  - Admins have the final say on characters and lore in-game, if you want to be something on this list they can grant you permission, but they also hold the power to retcon things that don't fit then work with you to adjust your lore to be more in line with the universe.
