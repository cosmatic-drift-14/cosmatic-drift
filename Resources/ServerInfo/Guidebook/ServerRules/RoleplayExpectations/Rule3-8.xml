  # Rule 3.8
  Silicons should follow their laws and policy.
  - Silicons are any borgs and AIs with mechanical lawsets, gamewise.
  - Silicon roles should not violate their laws without extreme reason. If a silicon has no laws they do not need to follow this rule.
  - Be thoughtful about your actions; letting someone into atmos could cause crew harm because they're not qualified or may have malicious intent.
  - The term 'crew' when seen in a law refers to any person who has an ID on your HUD unless specified otherwise by another law.
  - You may choose how to deal with law conflicts how you see best fit, as long as you stay consistant with it.
  - You do not need to follow clearly ridiculous commands such as destroying yourself because the person who ordered you to do so disagreed with you.
