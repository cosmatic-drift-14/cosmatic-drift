  # Rule 1.5
  Do not communicate in-round information about an on-going round through multiple accounts or to other people.
  - Communicating current-round info out of character - also known as "metacommunicating" - includes posting screenshots of a live round, talking about in-character events in out-of-character, sitting in a voice chat talking about the round, etc. It does not matter how minor it is, this is zero tolerance.
  - Do not multikey, which is to play or spectate in the same round with multiple accounts operated by you.
