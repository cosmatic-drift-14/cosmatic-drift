  # Rule 1.2
  This is an English only server, as we can not moderate other languages speaking full sentences in anything but English will usually lead to a single warning, then a ban if you do not cease.
  - You may only speak brief one to five word phrases in another language, as long as it doesn't break any of the other rules or is used to communicate with another player in the same language.
