  # Rule 2.1
  Do not be a huge dick and try not to over-escalate. You are playing a roleplaying game with other real people. Do not go out of your way to ruin the experience of other players, and do not grief.
  - Killing yourself while in security custody is considered being a dick, as they have little way to stop you without depriving you of your basic rights. If you wish to commit suicide while arrested ask to do so in ahelp.
  - Try to avoid permanently killing or "round-removing" other players. While this is acceptable if it is in pursuit of a direct antagonistic kill objective, it is generally frowned upon and should be avoided if possible.
  - Try your best not to negatively affect absent or SSD players. Stealing, killing, and griefing these players is disallowed, however, things such as moving a player to a safe area or security performing a search acceptable.
