  # Rule 2.3
  You are playing a high-roleplay server; speak and act like a human being. While playing in this server, you will be held to a higher standard of roleplay. With this being the case, you are expected to actively engage in roleplay when it comes up.
  - Do not use text speech such as "omg," "idk," "wtf," or "lol," while physically speaking as your character. Using text speech in non-verbal ways is fine, like writing on paper or in PDAs.
  - Referring to gamey terms like "admins" or "RNG" is disallowed.
  - Do not abuse emotes to bypass chat filters. Emotes should represent actions that your character could actually perform. Emotes should have effort put into them; this means that you should not be typing things such as "John Doe motions with his hands to signal syndicate agents west of you."
  - Do not respond to events in a highly unbelievable manner, stick to how your character would react.
