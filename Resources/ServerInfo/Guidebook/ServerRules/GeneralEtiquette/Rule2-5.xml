  # Rule 2.5
  Your character name should be believable and realistic.
  - Your name must only contain basic English letters and accented characters.
  - Your character name should not mimic popular real-life or fictional people, even if it is a "clever" plays on them, such as "White Walter."
  - Your character's name should not be phonetic word plays, such as "Mike Oxlong" or "Ben Dover."
  - Your name should not be overly dumb or gamey either, such as "John Graytide."
  - Names should not include titles, such as "Doctor," "Sergeant," or "Father."
