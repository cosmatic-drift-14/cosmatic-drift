  # Rule 2.2
  Do not commit major crimes without admin approval. We are a server that permits crime in the effort to further RP story lines, however it must be kept non-intensive if you're doing it without the guidance of an admin.
  - As a rule of thumb, if it significantly harms anyone other than yourself, causes a public or work location to be unusable or unsafe, or involves the theft of irreplaceable gear such as command gear, you should ahelp. If you are unsure if what you're about to do is a minor or major crime, always ahelp.
  - After you are caught and punished in-characterly, you are expected not to do the same crime again that round without an admin's approval.
  - The arrivals station, arrivals shuttle, and end round Central Command station are entirely off-limits; do not grief, attack others, or do any antagonistic acts in these locations under any circumstance, even as an antagonist.
