  # Server Rules
  Welcome to Cosmatic Drift, this is a High Roleplay server, meaning generally stay in character, put in an effort to roleplay out your character, and just enjoy the community.
  \nIf you have any questions please do not be afraid to ask our administration team in ahelp or in the questions channel on the Discord, we're happy to help.

  All Cosmatic Drift servers are strictly 16+ only. If you are underage, you [bold]will be banned[/bold] for double the amount of time that it takes for you to be of age.

  All rules apply at all times unless specified otherwise by an admin.

  [deadspace][Yes this is the only way I know how to do this]
