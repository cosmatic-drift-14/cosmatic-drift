  # Engineering

  The standard procedures followed by engineering staff on any uniform NT station. The Chief Engineer can edit, make additions, and make exceptions to their station's engineering operating procedures whenever they please as long as a copy of the changes is forwarded to the Captain's fax machine and another laid out in the engineering break room or other main room. The captain may veto any change made by the CE if they see fit. Anyone considered under the engineering department is required to follow this document.


  ## Engineering Construction

  Engineers are not exempt from construction requirements and are still required to follow the guidelines outlined in the Construction segment of General SOP.

  ## Fire Axe Usage

  Atmospheric's fire axe should be treated like a circumstantial tool, not a weapon. Carrying the fire axe around when there is not an atmospheric emergency, an authorized reason to cut down a structure, or a nearby immediate threat to crew life is considered failure to keep it secure and endangerment.

  ## Burn Chamber Safety

  Any burn chamber, or general chamber that atmospherics is using to house dangerous gasses outside of pipe networks, should be properly secured. This means that it should either be entirely surrounded by space, or be reinforced with plasma windows or stronger and be behind an atmospherics only door, preferably with an airlock system though not required.
