  # Cargo

  The standard procedures followed by cargo staff on any uniform NT station. The Quartermaster can edit, make additions, and make exceptions to their station's cargo operating procedures whenever they please as long as a copy of the changes is forwarded to the Captain's fax machine and another laid out in the cargo break room or other main room. The captain may veto any change made by the QM if they see fit. Anyone considered under the cargo department is required to follow this document.


  ## Salvaging Derelicts

  Salvage is not exempt from the derelict regulations and are still required to follow the guidelines outlined in the Derelicts segment of the General SOP. However Salvage can treat anything brought in by the salvaging magnet, found located around the station at crew shift start, or structures found on official NT assigned expeditions as automatically derelict with no reason to contact the company owner. Anything outside the automatic derelict list should not be salvaged without the Captain's approval.


  ## Salvaged Contraband

  Any equipment salvaged that is considered restricted or contraband should be disposed of or processed by security. Proper disposal includes leaving the gear in the same place you found it, tossing it to deep space, or selling it in the Automated Trade Station. Getting it processed by security can include handing it off to them to secure or getting a permit to use it for further salvaging.
