  # Service

  The standard procedures followed by service staff on any uniform NT station. The Head of Personnel can edit, make additions, and make exceptions to their station's service operating procedures whenever they please as long as a copy of the changes is forwarded to the Captain's fax machine and another laid out in the service break room or other main room. The captain may veto any change made by the HoP if they see fit. Anyone considered under the service department is required to follow this document.

  ## Fauna Disposal

  Any janitorial duty that includes cleaning up fauna corpses should be conducted properly to reduce risk of biohazards. This means the bodies should be disposed of correctly, a couple options include handing them off to medbay to morgue, giving them to the chef for preparing, tossing them to space, or using a crematorium.

  ## Unsafe Products

  Any service job that deals in serving products, including but not limited to chefs, bartenders, and botanists, should be aware of any potential health complications that the products they are serving may cause, excluding overconsumption of things such as alcohol. If a product is known to be unsafe for consumption, it must not be set in a publicly accessible area (such as a counter), however, they may still be served as long as the consumer is properly notified of the associated health risks and acknowledges the damage the product may cause. Failing to follow these restrictions is considered endangerment and the offending personnel will be held responsible for any harm done.
