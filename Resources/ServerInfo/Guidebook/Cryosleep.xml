## Why Should You Enter Cryosleep
Cryosleep is an incredibly valuable tool for station crew, allowing them to leave the shift before the emergency shuttle arrives.

## Entering Cryosleep
While some stations come equipped with a Cryosleep Casket your most reliable way of finding them is by returning to Central Command via the Arrivals Shuttle.

Upon returning to Central Command, the cryosleep chambers can easily be found by following the signs labeled "Cryo". Once there, you can insert yourself into a Cryosleep Casket, safely storing your body until your next shift.
