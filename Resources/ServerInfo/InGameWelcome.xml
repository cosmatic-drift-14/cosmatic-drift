# Welcome to Cosmatic Drift!

[color=#FDDA0D]Cosmatic Drift is a High Roleplay Space Station 14 server[/color]
where players are intended to maintain relationships from round-to-round. If you
are new feel free to ask for help in LOOC (local OOC) or OOC. Remember that you
should not discuss IC events in OOC during the round.

[color=#FDDA0D]You are currently on the arrivals terminal and need to transfer
to the station.[/color] Simply enter one of the main halls and follow the yellow
arrows on the ground to head to the docking bay.

Our rounds typically last for 2-5 hours. [color=#FDDA0D]You are not expected to
stay for the entire round.[/color] If you need to leave early, please try to
head to a Cryosleep chamber (follow the signs on the station, or take the
shuttle back to arrivals). This will remove you from the round and open your role
up for someone else to play. If you come back, you will be able to respawn as another
character. If you are playing command and are not able to make it to a Cryosleep
chamber for whatever reason please notify the admins via ahelp.

See the gudebook for more information.

Lastly, if you need something from admins [color=#FDDA0D]please don't hesitate to ahelp[/color].
This is not limited to rules related things. The admins are happy to modify your
character, give you an antagonist role, and do many other things. The worst they can
say is no. The only way to get an antagonist role is to ask via ahelp!
