station-event-ion-storm-synth = You detect an Ion Storm. Your internal systems may be tampered with or damaged as a result. 

station-event-space-dust-minor-start-announcement = The station is passing through a small debris cloud, expect very minor damage to external fittings and fixtures.
station-event-space-dust-moderate-start-announcement = The station is passing through a debris cloud, expect some damage to exposed station fixtures.
station-event-meteor-swarm-small-start-announcement = A small meteor field has been detected on collision course with the station. Please be cautious around exposed areas of the station.
station-event-meteor-swarm-moderate-start-announcement = A meteor field has been detected on collision course with the station. Crew are advised to avoid exposed areas of the station, and inform engineering staff of any damaged locations.
station-event-meteor-swarm-heavy-start-announcement = A large meteor field is on a collision course with the station. Station crew are advised to head towards a central, safe area, and engineering staff should prepare for heavy damage.
